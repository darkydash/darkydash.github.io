					<h2>Negative perspectives of united Russia</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The high costs of exploration and of oil and gas in Russia's inhospitable physical and investment climate, as well as stifling government control, make eco­nomic slowdown a real possibility.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Lack of predictability and insufficient protection of investor rights is a strong deterrent to foreign investment, specifi­cally in non-natural resources sectors of the econ­omy. If these sectors do not grow, the Russian economy will be at
						the mercy of fluctuations in commodity prices.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Instead of privatizing Gazprom, however, Rus­sia has transferred to it a significant part of the oil sector and is using the giant company as an instru­ment of foreign policy. As the government's appe­tite for spending grows, Russia will
						likely have to rely on its stabilization fund to finance the govern­ment budget. The Kremlin may be faced with mounting economic difficulties sooner than expected.</p>

					<h2>Interesting facts</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now In "United Russia" is more than 2 million people. And this number is growing. Of these, 40% is employed in industry and education, 5,5% work in agriculture. And almost 8% - health workers, about 4,5% - workers of culture and art. There
						are students and pensioners, of course, there are officials. So, in the civil service and in government now more than 13% of members of United Russia is more than a tenth.</p>
